This repo is for tracking issues / project management for the Remote Settings v2 Project. 

## What is Remote Settings V2? 

These attributes differentiate V1 from V2: 

1. Self serve setting creation 
1. Simplier API in Firefox
1. Targeting ability. Setting values can be different based on Firefox's criteria (platform, locale, version, etc)
1. Reduced update latency. Support for broadcast API (server push) as well as polling
